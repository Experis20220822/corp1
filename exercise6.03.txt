Exercise 6.03: Tabbed Content
In this exercise, you'll use what you have learned so far to create a tabbed display. The display will utilize three buttons at the top of the page, with a container div tag at the bottom. When a button is pressed, content associated with the button handler will be displayed within the container div tag. Let's get started:

First, create a new document called tabs.html and add the starting HTML:
<html>

  <head>

    <title>Tabbed Display</title>

  </head>

  <body>

The three buttons will sit side by side in a single container div. Each one will have a unique ID so that we can easily reference them:
    <div>

      <button id="btn1">Tab One</button>

      <button id="btn2">Tab Two</button>

      <button id="btn3">Tab Three</button>

    </div>

Next, add the container div. We'll add a descriptive body to inform the user of the page. However, once a button has been pressed, that content will disappear for good and will be replaced by dynamic content:
    <div id="container">Click a button!</div>

With the structure of the page in place, you can now close out the body and begin the script block:
  </body>  <script>    let btn1 = document.getElementById("btn1"),

      btn2 = document.getElementById("btn2"),

      btn3 = document.getElementById("btn3"),

      container = document.getElementById("container");

Here, we've created a variable for each element in the page we need to interact with. This makes the code neater and cleaner.

Next, you'll need some content to add when the buttons are pressed, one for each button:
    let content1 = "Button 1 was pressed",

      content2 = "Button 2 was pressed",

      content3 = "Button 3 was pressed";

Now, we need to wire up the content. To do this, simply add an event listener to each button, updating the container div content in each one:
    btn1.addEventListener("click", () => container.innerHTML = content1);

    btn2.addEventListener("click", () => container.innerHTML = content2);

    btn3.addEventListener("click", () => container.innerHTML = content3);

Now, simply close out the open tags and save the page:
  </script>

</html>

That's it. If you now run the page in your browser and click each button, you should see that the content has been updated.
