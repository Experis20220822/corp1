Exercise 3.16: Writing an Arrow Function and Invoking It
This exercise will show you how to convert a function expression into an arrow function. The JavaScript file we'll be using already contains the function. Let's get started:

Open the function-arrow.html document in your web browser.
Open the web developer console window using your web browser.
Reload the function-arrow.html web page in your web browser with the console window open.
The first, second from last, and last results are an empty string. The second, third, and fourth results show a random character from the string:

():

("AEIOU"): U

("124678"): 6

("JavaScript"): a

(124678):

(true):

Open the function-arrow.js document in your code editor, make changes to the bolded lines, and then save it:
let getRandomStringCharacter = (source) => {

 let returnCharacter = '';

 if (source !=undefined &&source.length> 0){

returnCharacter = source.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * source.length));

 }

 return returnCharacter;

}

Reload the function-arrow.html web page in your web browser with the console window open.
The results are the same. The first, second from last, and last results are an empty string. The second, third, and fourth results show a random character from the string:

():

("AEIOU"): I

("124678"): 2

("JavaScript"): J

(124678):

(true):
